Money Machine/Wage display was created to help visualize your income. How many cents do you make per second? How long does an hour feel?
What is it like to make $1000 an hour?
These questions are answered in a visual display to help understand your income.

Simply enter the desired wage amount, and hit start. Add minutes or hours utilizing the top buttons. Stopping will pause the timers, and start will reset it with the new wage.
You can change wage while the timer is active. The exit button will close the program.
